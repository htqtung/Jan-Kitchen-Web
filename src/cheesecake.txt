<p>I often get a bit stuck for knowing what to make next on my blog. I often ask for suggestions, which anyone who is reading this is welcome to do in the comments below, so that I can be inspired again. One thing that that has come up time again is a Neapolitan themed treat. I have a Neapolitan Cake &amp; Cupcakes coming soon, but I wanted to start with something a little different. the Neapolitan Cheesecake.<br><br>I had searched through Pinterest for these, and I hadn’t come across many. There’s many Neapolitan themed treats, and obviously cakes are one of the major players in the category, but only a handful of Cheesecakes. After the success of my No-Bake Triple Chocolate Cheesecake, I thought I would base this new treat on that.<br><br>The layers on this one don’t look as satisfying as my No-Bake Triple Chocolate Cheesecake, because I was in a a bit of a rush when I made this one (I had 20 minutes to make and leave the house!) but I am still pretty content with how it came out. The mixture of flavours is an absolute dream. I love the combination, and I did as a child through the Ice-Cream I used to have. I will admit however that I used to avoid the Strawberry section as I was a chocolate lover as a child. I now however understand that the three flavours together are an absolute dream!<br><br>I realise that this is a bit of a faff to make in comparison to my other cheesecakes such as my No-Bake Caramac Cheesecake, but it is SO worth it if you like Vanilla, Strawberry and Chocolate flavours. Honestly, I am surprised by how much I liked this one. The little bit of sweetened cream on the top, the crunch of the chocolate curls, and if you’re lucky a fresh strawberry along with the cheesecake is so utterly delicious I can’t cope. I hope you guys like this recipe, and look forward to more Neapolitan treats in the future! Enjoy!</p>
